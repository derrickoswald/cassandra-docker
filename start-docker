# Amazon's AMI (e.g. ami-c91624b0 - amzn-ami-2018.03.a-amazon-ecs-optimized (2018-05-17T14:49:42.000Z) Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.a x86_64 ECS HVM GP2)
# has a very small limit on the maximum number of open files (4096),
# which was hit because the program was leaking sockets, but fixed so I didn't need to change the file limit,
# but theoretically, if you need to increase the host's allowed limit (the docker container itself has a limit of 1M = 1024 Ã— 1024)
# you should:
# 1) add the following line to /etc/systemd/user.conf and /etc/systemd/system.conf (which don't exist in the AMI image):
#   DefaultLimitNOFILE=65535
# 2) add the following four lines to /etc/security/limits.conf (which does exist):
#   root hard nofile 65535
#   root soft nofile 65535
#   ec2-user hard nofile 65535
#   ec2-user soft nofile 65535
# and then re-login and test with:
#   ulimit -Hn
#   65535
